## Features

- **Real-time Disease Detection**: Upload leaf images to instantly identify diseases
- **High Accuracy**: Powered by a CNN model trained on a large dataset of plant diseases
- **User Accounts**: Create accounts to track disease detection history
- **Custom Model Retraining**: Upload your own data to retrain the model
- **Visualization Tools**: View confusion matrices, accuracy graphs, and other metrics

## Supported Plants & Diseases

The model can detect diseases in 14 different plant species, including Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn/Maize, Grape, Orange, Peach, Bell Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, and Tomato with various disease conditions.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React 19
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- React Router

### Backend
- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI
- TensorFlow 2.15
- SQLAlchemy (MySQL)
- MongoDB (for visualizations)
- JWT Authentication

## Installation

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Samenergy/PlantDiseaseDetectionApp.git
cd PlantDiseaseDetectionApp
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd Backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables (.env file)
# DATABASE_URL=mysql://username:password@localhost/plant_disease_db
# SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
# MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017

# Run the backend
cd src
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Testing

For testing the application without collecting your own plant images, you can use the sample images provided:

```bash
cd Backend/Data
```

This directory contains sample leaf images organized by plant type and disease condition that you can use to test the disease detection functionality.

## Usage

1. Create an account or login
2. Upload an image of a plant leaf
3. View the disease detection results and recommendations
4. Check your prediction history
5. (Optional) Upload a dataset to retrain the model for improved accuracy
